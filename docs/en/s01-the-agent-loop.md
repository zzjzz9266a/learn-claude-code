## Problem

A language model can reason about code, but it can't *touch* the real world -- can't read files, run tests, or check errors. Without a loop, every tool call requires you to manually copy-paste results back. You become the loop.

## Solution

```
+--------+      +-------+      +---------+
|  User  | ---> |  LLM  | ---> |  Tool   |
| prompt |      |       |      | execute |
+--------+      +---+---+      +----+----+
                    ^                |
                    |   tool_result  |
                    +----------------+
                    (loop until stop_reason != "tool_use")
```

One exit condition controls the entire flow. The loop runs until the model stops calling tools.

## How It Works

1. User prompt becomes the first message.

```ts
messages.push({ role: "user", content: query });
```

2. Send messages + tool definitions to the LLM.

```ts
const response = await client.messages.create({
  model: MODEL,
  system: SYSTEM,
  messages,
  tools: TOOLS,
  max_tokens: 8000,
});
```

3. Append the assistant response. Check `stop_reason` -- if the model didn't call a tool, we're done.

```ts
messages.push({ role: "assistant", content: response.content });
if (response.stop_reason !== "tool_use") {
  return;
}
```

4. Execute each tool call, collect results, append as a user message. Loop back to step 2.

```ts
const results = [];
for (const block of response.content) {
  if (block.type !== "tool_use") continue;
  const output = await runCommand(block.input.command);
  results.push({
    type: "tool_result",
    tool_use_id: block.id,
    content: output,
  });
}
messages.push({ role: "user", content: results });
```

Assembled into one function:

```ts
async function agentLoop(query: string) {
  const messages: Message[] = [{ role: "user", content: query }];

  while (true) {
    const response = await client.messages.create({
      model: MODEL,
      system: SYSTEM,
      messages,
      tools: TOOLS,
      max_tokens: 8000,
    });

    messages.push({ role: "assistant", content: response.content });

    if (response.stop_reason !== "tool_use") {
      return;
    }

    const results = [];
    for (const block of response.content) {
      if (block.type !== "tool_use") continue;
      const output = await runCommand(block.input.command);
      results.push({
        type: "tool_result",
        tool_use_id: block.id,
        content: output,
      });
    }

    messages.push({ role: "user", content: results });
  }
}
```

That's the entire agent in under 30 lines. Everything else in this course layers on top -- without changing the loop.

## What Changed

| Component     | Before     | After                          |
|---------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| Agent loop    | (none)     | `while (true)` + stop_reason   |
| Tools         | (none)     | `bash` (one tool)              |
| Messages      | (none)     | Accumulating list              |
| Control flow  | (none)     | `stop_reason != "tool_use"`    |

## Try It

```sh
cd learn-claude-code
npm run s01
```

1. `Create a file called hello.ts that prints "Hello, World!"`
2. `List all TypeScript files in this directory`
3. `What is the current git branch?`
4. `Create a directory called test_output and write 3 files in it`
